body.explanation: |
  The German language has a beautiful word for it called *Briefschmerz*. That's the anxiety we all get when we open our mail and see any letter, and we think it might be the Finanzamt, another amt or bad news.

  That can ruin our day or simply be another supermarket Werbung. That's the thing... we never know!!

  Just know this, you are not alone, and the Briefschmerz is real!

body.urbandictionary: |
  A feeling of intense anxiety and/or psychological distress. Literally "letter pain". Named after the feeling anyone residing in Germany gets after seeing they have letters in their postbox. To be used literally or metaphorically.

  LITERAL:

  _"Hey, wanna go for a späti beer?"_
  _"Can't dude, just saw a letter from the finanzamt and the briefschmerz is REAL"_

  METAPHORICAL

  _"OMG my boss called me in for a meeting and I thought I was in trouble and I had a full on briefschmerz episode"_
